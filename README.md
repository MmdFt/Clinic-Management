# Clinic Management System

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive Clinic Management System built with Java. The system aims to streamline the process of patient registration, consultation, and billing in a clinic setting. The application is console-based, ensuring it can be used on any system that supports Java without the need for an extensive user interface.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project was to develop a practical understanding of Object Oriented Programming principles and Java programming. Additionally, the project provided exposure to various aspects of software development, such as system design, requirements analysis, implementation, and testing. 

## Features
- Registration of doctors, patients, receptionists, and cashiers.
- Doctor specialization management.
- Patient treatment workflow, from registration to bill payment.
- Robust queue management for handling patient's turns.
- Detailed logging of patients, doctors, and employees for effective tracking.

## Code Design
The design of the code follows good engineering practices and Object-Oriented Programming principles. Here's a summary of the design principles and practices used:

- **Encapsulation:** The classes are well-encapsulated with private fields and public methods, providing a clear interface and hiding the internal implementation details.
- **Inheritance:** Extensive use of inheritance for a clear, hierarchical structure, making the code easier to understand and manage. For example, different types of doctors inherit from the `Doctor` base class.
- **Serialization:** Java serialization has been used for persisting the state of objects.
- **Polymorphism:** Leveraged polymorphism to allow objects to take on many forms depending on the context, increasing the flexibility of the code.
- **Modularity:** The code is divided into different modules (classes) according to functionality, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling, thus enhancing maintainability.
